      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>The check engine light comes on when the engine management system has detected faults in the engine or transmission. The problem can be as simple as a loose gas cap or as complex as internal engine damage.</p>
      <h3>We Recommend</h3>
      <p class="recommended">Check Engine Light is on (Inspection)</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>When this light is on, car's monitoring system will have 'fault codes' that indicate the nature of the problem. Your car may have one or more problems and hence there can be multiple codes. <br>
      Your mechanic will:</p>
      <ul class="ABS_menu">
        <li>Read the codes using scanner</li>
        <li>Interpret the code</li>
        <li>Provide a preliminary diagnosis and repair estime</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you approve the repair estimate, they will:</p>
      <ul class="ABS_menu">
        <li>Replace the faulty part(s)</li>
        <li>Clear the memory of any fault codes</li>
        <li>Turn the check engine light off</li>
        <li>Let you drive the car for a few days to see if the light comes back on or not</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note: <br>
It may take several days of driving the car for the monitoring system to verify that the repair has fixed all the problems. If the monitoring system fails any of its internal tests, it will turn the light back on. This means that the car has more problems that were not evident during the first evaluation. Your mechanic will have to perform further diagnosis and create new repair estimates for resolving the problems found. In some rare cases, multiple visits may be required to diagnose and resolve the stubborn check engine light issues.</p>

    <div class="Tire DELL">
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tire pressure is too low or high</li>
        <li>Tire pressure sensor is bad</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the tire pressure is too low or high, add or remove air accordingly. You may need to reset the tire pressure light as per the owner's manual. If this does not solve the problem, the tire pressure sensor is bad. YourMechanic.com does not offer tire pressure sensor replacement service at this point.</p>
      <h3>What You Should Do</h3>
      <p>If adjusting the tire pressure does not help, we recommend taking the car to a tire shop.
Note: We currently dont offer this service and recommend taking the car to a local shop or dealer.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>

    <div class="Appointment_Overdrive DELL">
       <h3>Explanation</h3>
       <p>This is the Overdrive indicator light, not a warning light (it's ok for the light to be ON). An overdrive is a mechanical gear system that the transmission uses to provide your car with better gas mileage at higher speeds. If your overdrive light is on, the overdrive is not selected or engaged. If the overdrive light is off, overdrive is actively engaged.<br>If the light is flashing or blinking, then you have a problem within the overdrive system or transmission.</p>
